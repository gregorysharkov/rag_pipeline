This effort arises as consumers lost over $1 trillion to scams globally last year, and law enforcement struggles to manage the sheer volume of online scams. Modeled after threat intelligence units in cybersecurity, Visa's team proactively studies and disrupts scam operations, having already thwarted over $350 million in attempted fraud in 2024. The team focuses on expanding intelligence-gathering, accelerating scam takedowns, and investing in AI and automation to enhance detection capabilities. This initiative underscores Visa's commitment to safeguarding its customers and platforms against fraud.",

This initiative shifts the burden of fraud prevention to banks, compelling them to invest significantly in detection and prevention. Last year, nearly 3 million Britons lost over ¬£1.1 billion to fraud. While the new regulations cap automatic reimbursements at ¬£85,000, cases above this will be dealt with individually, potentially causing delays in high-value cases. Banks are now required to share responsibility for fraudulent transactions, urging all financial institutions to heighten their fraud prevention measures. There are concerns about new risks and \"moral hazard\" if customers become complacent about security. Banks will also begin using AI technology to better detect and prevent fraud. A year-long review of the system's effectiveness is planned, as the industry adjusts to these significant changes.",

The study, conducted by Say No to Disinfo and Fenimore Harper, warns that AI can create fake news and memes about bank security, leading to significant withdrawals. This follows concerns raised after the 2023 Silicon Valley Bank collapse, where $42 billion was withdrawn in 24 hours, exacerbated by social media. The G20‚Äôs Financial Stability Board previously noted that generative AI could cause financial crises. The UK study showed that a significant portion of bank customers would consider moving their money after viewing AI-generated fake content. Banks are urged to enhance media and social media monitoring to identify and mitigate the impact of disinformation. The report estimated that ¬£10 spent on social media ads could lead to the movement of up to ¬£1 million in deposits. Financial institutions and regulators are increasingly attentive to the risks, and the study calls for greater involvement from social media platforms in addressing these threats.",

    üéØ Why Traditional Systems Are Failing
    üîπ Most legacy fraud prevention systems rely on rigid rules and manual checks. These methods struggle to adapt to new scams and often produce false results, with high error rates.
    üîπ Cybercriminals now use sophisticated tactics: identity spoofing, account takeovers, social engineering, and push-payment scams (where victims willingly transfer money to fraudsters).

    Banks and payment companies are now aggressively adopting AI solutions. AI operates at three key levels:
    1Ô∏è‚É£ Identity Verification: Analyzes data, cross-references databases, and flags suspicious users.
    2Ô∏è‚É£ Authentication: Detects behavioral patterns (typing speed, response time).
    3Ô∏è‚É£ Fraud Detection: Evaluates transactions, identifies anomalies, and blocks suspicious activity in real time.

    Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are revolutionizing fraud prevention. Instead of analyzing single transactions, GNNs map global connections between accounts, devices, and actions.

    üî• Banks are turning to cloud platforms and advanced computing systems. For example, AWS and NVIDIA‚Äôs collaboration uses Amazon Neptune ML with GNNs to map complex relationships, boosting prediction accuracy by 50%. Tests show banks can train models 14x faster and cut costs 8x.

    As online fraud grows more sophisticated, outdated systems can‚Äôt keep up. Financial institutions that adopt AI will protect clients, safeguard their reputation, and gain a competitive edge.
