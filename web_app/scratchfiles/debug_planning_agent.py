    üéØ Why Traditional Systems Are Failing
    üîπ Most legacy fraud prevention systems rely on rigid rules and manual checks. These methods struggle to adapt to new scams and often produce false results, with high error rates.
    üîπ Cybercriminals now use sophisticated tactics: identity spoofing, account takeovers, social engineering, and push-payment scams (where victims willingly transfer money to fraudsters).

    Banks and payment companies are now aggressively adopting AI solutions. AI operates at three key levels:
    1Ô∏è‚É£ Identity Verification: Analyzes data, cross-references databases, and flags suspicious users.
    2Ô∏è‚É£ Authentication: Detects behavioral patterns (typing speed, response time).
    3Ô∏è‚É£ Fraud Detection: Evaluates transactions, identifies anomalies, and blocks suspicious activity in real time.

    Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are revolutionizing fraud prevention. Instead of analyzing single transactions, GNNs map global connections between accounts, devices, and actions.

    üî• Banks are turning to cloud platforms and advanced computing systems. For example, AWS and NVIDIA‚Äôs collaboration uses Amazon Neptune ML with GNNs to map complex relationships, boosting prediction accuracy by 50%. Tests show banks can train models 14x faster and cut costs 8x.

    As online fraud grows more sophisticated, outdated systems can‚Äôt keep up. Financial institutions that adopt AI will protect clients, safeguard their reputation, and gain a competitive edge.
